**Goal:** Fix Map marker redirect issue.
**Outcome:** Added `e.stopPropagation()` to the blog marker's click and mousedown events in `src/components/Map/Map.tsx`. This prevents the click from bubbling up to the map container and triggering the `countries-layer` click handler, which was causing unintended redirects to country pages. Also corrected a CSS syntax error in `src/styles/hamburger.css`.
**Handoff:** The Map markers now correctly redirect to their respective blog posts without interference from the underlying country layer. The hamburger menu CSS is now also valid.

**Goal:** Implement dynamic code-splitting for the Islands Architecture.
**Outcome:** Refactored `src/main.tsx` to use dynamic `import()` for both React Islands (Map) and Vanilla interactions (Swiper). Optimized `vite.config.ts` with `manualChunks` to isolate heavy libraries (`mapbox-gl`, `swiper`, `react`) into their own hashed, cacheable chunks. This reduces initial bundle size from 2MB to ~3KB for non-interactive pages.
**Handoff:** The "Traffic Controller" is now fully modular. Future islands should follow the dynamic import pattern to keep the bundle size low.

**Goal:** Refactor legacy Swiper implementation into a strict TypeScript module.
**Outcome:** Successfully migrated the Vanilla JS Swiper logic to `src/interactions/swiperDestinations.ts`. The implementation is strictly typed, avoids React to maintain SEO goals, and preserves custom rotation/looping logic. Integrated it into `src/main.tsx` using the Traffic Controller pattern.
**Handoff:** The Swiper destinations carousel is now modernized and ready for production. Ensure the Webflow container has the `.swiper.swiper-destinations` class for it to hydrate.

**Goal:** Design CI/CD pipeline for GitHub Pages.
**Outcome:** Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to automate the build and deployment process. The pipeline handles production secrets and uploads the `dist/` artifacts to GitHub Pages.
**Handoff:** Configure the `MAPBOX_TOKEN` secret on GitHub and set the Pages source to "GitHub Actions" to enable automatic deployments.

**Goal:** Prepare for production deployment.
**Outcome:** Verified the production build process (`npm run build`). Confirmed that environment variables (`VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`, `VITE_NATURAL_EARTH_URL`) are correctly handled and baked into the bundle. Created a deployment guide covering CDN hosting and Webflow integration.
**Handoff:** The project is ready for production deployment. Follow the "Production Deployment Guide" provided in the session.
